"""Post-turn self-review — judge the latest turn for worth-remembering facts.

Lighter-grained than the batch extractor: runs every few turns over the
latest single turn, writes only structured memories (facts/preferences),
never the conversation logs table.

Isolation rule (Hermes background_review pattern): the reviewer must NOT call
store.log_turn. If it did, its own prompt+reply would enter recent_turns and
corrupt the rolling summary (extractor) and the compiler's today/week digests.
